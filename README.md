            Press 'Run All'. 
            It will take around 10 minutes to run the whole file,
            but you can see the plot for each cell;
            each cell takes around 3 minutes to run.




Exercise 4: Run actor_only.ipynb. Press 'Run All'.
            It will take around 3 minutes to run,

Exercise 5: Run actor_critic.ipynb. Press 'Run All'.
            It will take around 1 minute to run,
