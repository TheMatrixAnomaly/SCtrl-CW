To reproduce the plots in the report, do:
(Note that the plots will look slightly different everytime you run, but still they will have the similar trend.)

Exercise 1: Run ex1_plots.ipynb file. It calls exercise1.py file.
            Press 'Run All'. 
            It will take around 10 minutes to run the whole file,
            but you can see the plot for each cell;
            each cell takes around 3 minutes to run.

Excercise 2,3 : Corresponding notebook : SCtrl CW V1 (1).ipynb : SoftLQR , Trajectory Simulations, Critic-only ;
Run all the cells in the notebook. Input parameters may be specified/modified in the example usages already provided.



Exercise 4: Run actor_only.ipynb. Press 'Run All'.
            It will take around 3 minutes to run,
            and you can see the learning progress while it's running.

Exercise 5: Run actor_critic.ipynb. Press 'Run All'.
            It will take around 1 minute to run,
            and you can see the learning progress while it's running.
